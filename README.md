Extra Credit Python HW Attempt

INSTRUCTIONS:
Write a series of Python classes to model students, professors, course, classes, and majors. Implement as many of the magic methods as make sense for your model. Submit a git repo with a readme describing how to use your classes.
I will leave the specifics up to you but you should implement things like add/drop class, get_advisor/advisee, course requirements, major requirements.
Note that a class is a specific term offering of a course which is a more general description.

The standard for 10% extra credit would be a barebones model with a readme ~100-150 lines of code. 20% would include a full demo and documentation ~500+ lines of code.
